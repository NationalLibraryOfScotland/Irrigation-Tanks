# Irrigation tanks in the Kaveri River Delta, South India

This application was created by Charlotte Evans (Lancaster University) and Chris Fleet (National Library of Scotland). It is part of a PhD project studying water histories and digital mapping in the Kaveri river delta.

The map viewer uses <a href="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers</a> 4.6.5 for the map interface, <a href="https://jqueryui.com/"JQuery</a> for some interactive features, and a <a href="https://www.maptiler.com/desktop/">MapTiler</a> georeferenced mosaic in the left-hand map panel. For the date slider, we used the jQuery UI slider, adapting a date range slider example.
