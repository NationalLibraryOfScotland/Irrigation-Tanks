# Irrigation tanks in the Kaveri River Delta, South India

This application was created by Charlotte Evans (Lancaster University) and Chris Fleet (National Library of Scotland). It is part of a PhD project studying water histories and digital mapping in the Kaveri river delta.

The map viewer uses <a href="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers</a> 4.6.5 for the map interface, <a href="https://jqueryui.com/">JQuery</a> for some interactive features, and a <a href="https://www.maptiler.com/desktop/">MapTiler</a> georeferenced mosaic in the left-hand map panel. For the transparency slider, we used <a href="https://github.com/seiyria/bootstrap-slider">Bootstrap slider</a>.

The original viewer was adapted from the NLS <a href="https://github.com/NationalLibraryOfScotland/SidebySideOL3">Side-by-side viewer</a>.


The <a href="https://github.com/NationalLibraryOfScotland/InnesJamaicaJournal/blob/main/scripts/index.js">sidebyside.js</a> Javascript file contains the bespoke functions for this viewer, and is commented to explain the specific content and functions within it.
